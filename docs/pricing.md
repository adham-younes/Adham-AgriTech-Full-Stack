## Billing & Payment Rails

- **Stripe** powers international credit-card and wallet payments with automated invoicing, subscription management, and support for PSD2/SCA.
- **PayTabs** provides MENA-local card processing, Mada/KNET payments, and supports settlement in EGP/SAR/AED.
- Customers can toggle between providers per workspace; taxes and currency rules are applied automatically using Stripe Tax or PayTabs VAT APIs.

### Checkout Configuration

- `pages/api/billing` accepts `billingInterval` (`"month"` or `"year"`), optional checkout currency overrides, and a list of add-on SKUs so that the Stripe/PayTabs helpers can assemble plan + usage bundles automatically.
- Set the published Stripe price identifiers via the environment variables `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_PRO_MONTHLY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_PRO_ANNUAL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_ENTERPRISE_MONTHLY`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_ENTERPRISE_ANNUAL`. Custom enterprise quotes can provide a `customUnitAmount` instead.
- Per-service add-ons map to the `SERVICE_PRICING` catalog, ensuring both checkout providers share the same SKU identifiers and currency rules.

## Invoicing & Receipts Automation

1. **Subscription Lifecycle**
   - Webhooks from Stripe/PayTabs update the `billing_subscriptions` table (status, next billing date, payment method).
   - Renewal attempts trigger automated invoice generation via the `/api/billing` endpoint.
   - Receipts are emailed instantly with PDF attachments stored in object storage (Supabase bucket `billing-documents`).
2. **Usage-Based Charges**
   - Usage metrics recorded through `lib/analytics` accumulate per billing period.
   - Scheduled jobs (cron/Supabase Edge Functions) transform raw metrics into invoice line items (SKU, quantity, rate).
   - Administrators can review drafts inside the dashboard revenue workspace before auto-finalization.
3. **Revenue Reporting**
   - Revenue dashboards aggregate invoices, payments, refunds, and outstanding balances.
   - Filters cover date range, region, payment provider, and crop-specific services to help finance teams reconcile settlements.

## Upgrade & Downgrade Flows

- Freemium users initiate upgrade from any paywalled feature; the system requests a checkout session via `/api/billing`.
- Plan downgrades are scheduled at period end to avoid mid-cycle disruption and to ensure prorated credit compliance.
- Admins can grant temporary feature unlocks (e.g., trial satellite imagery) using the `feature_overrides` array stored with each profile.

## Compliance & Regional Considerations

- Stripe data residency in the EU (Frankfurt) with replication to Bahrain for redundancy.
- PayTabs contracts enforce PCI DSS SAQ-D compliance; card data never touches Adham AgriTech servers.
- Egyptian VAT invoices adhere to e-invoicing regulations with sequential numbering and Arabic translations automatically generated.

For implementation specifics, refer to `lib/domain/types/billing.ts`, `lib/services/billing.ts`, and the `/dashboard/reports/revenue` dashboard module.

## Usage Analytics API

- `GET /api/analytics/usage?userId=<uuid>&planId=<plan>&from=<iso>&to=<iso>` returns the cached usage summary leveraged by
  the paywall boundary to render upgrade hints and remaining allowances.
- `POST /api/analytics/usage` accepts a usage event body matching `UsageEvent` in `lib/analytics` and persists the action to
  Supabase (or the in-memory buffer when the service client is unavailable).
- Optional `flushMemory=true` may be passed to the GET endpoint during local development to clear the in-memory event buffer
  after metrics are synced.
