# 🚦 Deployment Status – 4 February 2025

This report captures the current publication state from inside the development container. The focus is on verifying whether the latest local changes have reached the live Vercel environment and identifying anything blocking that flow.

## 1. Source control linkage

- **Git remotes:** _Not configured_. Running `git remote -v` returns no entries, so the container cannot push updates to GitHub from here.
- **Action required:** add the production repository, for example `git remote add origin git@github.com:<org>/<repo>.git`, then push the desired branch.

## 2. Automated Vercel checks

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm vercel:status` | ❌ Fails – `[vercel] Missing access token. Provide --token or set VERCEL_TOKEN.` |

The status inspector is operational, but it needs a valid `VERCEL_TOKEN` plus `VERCEL_PROJECT`/`VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` in the environment before it can reach the Vercel API.

## 3. Readiness scan

A new helper script is available to surface all prerequisites in one pass:

```bash
pnpm vercel:check
```

Sample output from this workspace:

```
Vercel deployment readiness report:

❌ VERCEL_TOKEN
   Vercel access token
   Missing environment variable.

❌ VERCEL_PROJECT / VERCEL_PROJECT_ID
   Vercel project identifier (set VERCEL_PROJECT or VERCEL_PROJECT_ID)
   Provide one of the identifiers so the deployment scripts can target the correct project.

⚠️ VERCEL_TEAM_ID
   Vercel team ID
   Optional variable is missing; set it if the project belongs to a Vercel team.

⚠️ git remote
   Connected Git remotes
   No git remotes configured. Add the GitHub repository before attempting to push updates.

Summary: 0 passed, 2 warnings, 2 failed checks.
Resolve failed checks before attempting to trigger or monitor production deployments.
```

## 4. Next steps to publish

1. Configure Git remotes and push the current branch.
2. Export Vercel credentials in the terminal (or add them to your CI secrets):
   ```bash
   export VERCEL_TOKEN=... # personal access token with read+deploy scopes
   export VERCEL_PROJECT=adham-agritech
   # export VERCEL_TEAM_ID=team_... (only when using a team account)
   ```
3. Re-run `pnpm vercel:check` until all checks pass.
4. Inspect deployment history with `pnpm vercel:status --prod`.
5. Trigger a publish if needed via `pnpm vercel:deploy --target production` once credentials are in place.

Until these credentials and remotes are supplied, the container cannot confirm or push any deployment to the live domain.
